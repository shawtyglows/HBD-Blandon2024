                <div class="text">Blandon, <br><br>I’m so excited to celebrate you!!! I loved making this website and planning the day and everything
                     because the entire time I was just thinking of how badly I wanted you to feel special and loved and
                     cared for. That’s the absolute least you deserve!! You bring so much light and purpose to my life,
                    Brandon. In you, I have found a comedian, a pseudo-therapist, a financial advisor, a movie-watching buddy, a best friend, and a 
                    life partner <3. All of that wrapped up in a 5’4” Filipino body!! You have helped and shaped me in more ways than you know, and 
                    I truly think that I am a better person because of you. I to this day cannot believe how lucky I was to find you and how lucky 
                    I still am to be dating you! You really are such a special person, and I really mean it when I say this (I know you probably 
                    won’t believe me) but I knew it from the first day I met you. Something about you just stood out, and in a crowd of 40 new 
                    people, your name and face was the one that really stood out to me walking back from ShareTea that day. Following that day, 
                    I kind of just admired you from afar— not in a romantic way, per se. I admired your ability to engage with others, to connect 
                    with people with varying personalities, to make people feel comfortable, and to make others laugh. Even at such a surface level, 
                    there was so much to admire. But now, 15 months later, I realize that was only scratching the surface of how much there is about 
                    you to adore. I still look at you with that same admiration, but now, it’s due to your compassion, your level of understanding, 
                    your self-awareness, your honesty, your thoughtfulness, your kindness, your expressiveness and a million gajillion other things. 
                    I am just so so so in love with you, Brandon.
                    <br>
                    <br> Love,
                    <br>    Amanda
